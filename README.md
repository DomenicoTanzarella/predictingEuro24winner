### Predicting Euro 2024 winner

**Domenico Tanzarella**

#### Executive summary
The data is related to past performances of Eupean soccer national teams. 

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?
Soccer is an extrmely popular sport and can drive interest to technologies like ML.

#### Research Question
What are you trying to answer?
Use Machine Learning to predict the winner of Euro 2024

#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer you question?
The dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/football-soccer-uefa-euro-1960-2024/code) 

#### Methodology
What methods are you using to answer the question?
To frame the task, we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM. This process provides a framework for working through a data problem. 

#### Results
What did your research find?
Spain will win Euro2024: a result that matches common sense.

#### Next steps
- Playbook can be optimized: a lot of code is repeated, so there is an opportunity to do better
- Cross validation can be used to improve the performance of the classifiers
- Neural Networks, XGBoost could be used
- Add more data from the past, and verify accuracy improvment
